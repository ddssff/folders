 * 1. Too many open file descriptors bug
   2. Omit missing files if they are in missing direcories
   3. Detect when all files in a folder are duplicates
   4. Find folders that seem to be versions of one another
   5. In compare, avoid getDirectoryContents for folders that only
      exist on one side - so, parallel getSubdirectoryFilesRecursive
   6. We don't actually have to read the contents of every file in
      duplicates, we can start by comparing lengths and then only
      read when pairs have equal lengths.
